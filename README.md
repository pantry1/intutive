# Bitbucket Data Center Setup with Terraform

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Bitbucket Data Center using Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Terraform installed on your local machine
- Access to an infrastructure provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

## Steps

Follow these steps to set up Bitbucket Data Center with Terraform:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Change directory to the cloned repository:
    ```
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

3. Initialize Terraform:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```

4. Modify the `terraform.tfvars` file to configure your infrastructure provider credentials and other settings.

5. Review and customize the `main.tf` file to specify the desired Bitbucket Data Center configuration.

6. Plan the Terraform deployment to see the changes that will be applied:
    ```
    terraform plan
    ```

7. Deploy the Bitbucket Data Center infrastructure:
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

8. Confirm the changes and apply them by typing `yes` when prompted.

9. Once the deployment is complete, the Bitbucket Data Center setup should be ready for use.

## Configuration

You can customize the Bitbucket Data Center setup by modifying the following configuration files:

- `terraform.tfvars`: Contains the infrastructure provider credentials and other settings.
- `main.tf`: Defines the resources and their configurations for the Bitbucket Data Center deployment.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the setup process, refer to the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Check the Terraform logs for any error messages.
2. Verify that your infrastructure provider credentials are correct.
3. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create the required resources.
